F# ProjectScaffold
=======================

A prototypical F# library (file system layout and tooling), recommended by the F# Software Foundation.

This scaffolding can be used to generate the suggested structure of a typical F# library.
_(NOTE: this layout needs adjusting when authoring a Type Provider. In that case you should use a separate Tests solution)_

### Initializing

Run 

    ./build.sh
or

    ./build.cmd

You will be prompted for the name of your project and some other details. The project structure will then be generated from templates.

### Build and Release

After initialization, you can 

- Open, edit, build and test using ``ProjectName.sln``
- Build and test release binaries using ``build.cmd`` or ``build.sh `` 
- Build and test release packages using ``build.cmd Release`` or ``build.sh Release`` 
- Build and publish release docs using ``build.cmd ReleaseDocs`` or ``build.sh ReleaseDocs``
- Add assets to the GitHub releases (Look into the Release target in ``build.fsx``) 
- Publish packages using ``build.cmd Release`` or ``build.sh Release`` (and specify the NugetAccessKey)

        It contains a number of common tasks (i.e. build targets) such as directory cleaning, unit test execution, and NuGet package assembly.
        You are encouraged to adapt existing build targets and/or add new ones as necessary. However, if you are leveraging the default conventions,
        as setup in this scaffold project, you can start by simply supplying some values at the top of this file.

          <dt><code>summary</code></dt>
